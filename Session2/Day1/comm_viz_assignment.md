# Science Communication Project

For DSFP Session 2, you and your partner will develop a short presentation (6 min + 4 min for questions) to be delivered on Friday afternoon. Both students must talk during the presentation. The presentation should accomplish the following:
    
1. You must summarize and teach something you learned this week. 
    The intended audience is graduate students that are not experts in 
    machine learning.
2. Throughout the week we will encounter the 
    [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package 
    repeatedly. While `scikit-learn` is an amazing tool, with 
    exceptional documentation, many of the corresponding figures 
    could be improved. Using what you have learned about data 
    visualization throughout the week, download the source code 
    for a `scikit-learn` figure, and make substantial changes to 
    improve whatever the figure is attempting to communicate.
3. If possible, it's best if 2. relates to 1. Though in some cases 
    this may not be possible so this is not a requirement.

The presentations must be made as `iPython` slide shows, and they must be submitted, via github pull requests, by 12:30 pm on Friday.
